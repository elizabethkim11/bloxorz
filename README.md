# bloxorz.js

Hello! This is a 5-level 3D logical puzzle game, where the player moves a 2x1 block (aka bloxorz) around a platform with the goal of landing it upright onto a target square, which is shaded light blue.
We derived inspiration from the online web game Bloxorz, and impleneted our version using WebGL.

Be careful, since if you fall off the platform your progress will be reset to Level 1.

Controls:
* j - left
* i - up
* k - down
* l - right
* Enter - reset to level 1
* m - toggle music on/off

Enjoy!
